# Hello there 👋
I'm John, a Solutions Architect, currently leading the technical end-to-end implementation of Claro – a financial planning and investments platform. Claro is currently less than a year old, but has been recognised as a disrupter in the industry, being nominated for a British Bank Award in 2022.

I'm a certified AWS cloud architect, with 3+ years of hands-on industry experience designing and architecting cloud infrastructure. I am a strong advocate of serverless architectures, utilising its power to build de-coupled and resilient software components. 

I have working experience in both small, and large-scale financial and engineering environments, in various roles in the product, business and technology space. My time as a Technology Business Manager at HSBC saw cost-savings to the UK ring-fenced bank of approximately $98.5m, as a direct result of billing review efforts conducted by my team and I.

In 2021, I led a team of five graduates, technical and non-technical to victory at the annual global hackathon at HSBC with a social investments platform named 'MAJYK'. We placed 1st out of 29 global teams, and additionally won the AWS Partner Prize for our cloud solution.

During my studies, I spent one year on placement at GE Aviation, where I honed my skills in technologies that were 'closer to the metal', including C++ and assembly. I contributed to a data loader and operational flight program for the engine controller in a twin-engined, single-aisle, mid-range aircraft. I also worked on projects involving flight components as found in aircraft from the F35 to the Boeing 777X. I won multiple 'Impact Awards' for my contributions.

I graduated from King's College London with a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science, and won the King's Leadership Award of 2017/18. I wrote my dissertation on the topic of 'Congestion in TCP Networks', identifying and implementing complex yet efficient algorithms for alleviating traffic in computer networks.

Outside of my day job, I freelance as a lighting designer for small to medium-sized events such as dance shows, musicals and operas, with my previous clients including Underbelly Festival, Hackney Empire, Royal Academy of Music, Fat Rascal Theatre and many more. I'm also a committee member of VietPro – Europe's largest network for Vietnamese students and professionals. Each year, we run our flagship careers event titled 'Prospect', with the help of PwC. I'm also a pianist, classically trained at the Royal Academy of Music.
